            <h2>What is GURPS?</h2>
            <p>
                GURPS is a generic role-paying system created by Steve Jackson Games to help people play any game setting. This system uses point buy mechanic to help players and game master (GM) build their characters to fit the concept and setting that the gaming group wants to play.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike class based and levelling systems like Dungeons & Dragons, that have a set character path based on the class you chose such as wizard or a fighter, GURPS serves as a toolbox from which the players pick various traits approved by the GM and purchase them with character points. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This system is also setting agnostic, meaning it is easy to implement it to any type of game and setting you and your group want to play in. For example, you want to play a space opera fighting a evil crime syndicate that wants to overthrow the Galactic Federation, just to take few weeks after a refresher and play a classical medieval fantasy dungeon crawls, this system allows it.

        Why GURPS?
        <div>
            <h2>Why GURPS?</h2>
            <p>
                GURPS is a generic roleplaying system that is independent of setting and style of play. Some settings have more focus on combat like Dungeons and Dragons, other implement storytelling system like World of Darkness games, and most systems have mechanics that are tied to a specific setting or type of setting (e.g. medieval fantasy, modern setting, space exploration).
            </p>
            <p>
                Most systems have either a light abstract mechanic or a crunchy have mechanics that promote a lot of optimizations on the player side.  There is nothing wrong with either of these approaches, but for beginner players who are not sure how they want to play their game or game masters that want to implement a cool new thing in the game without thinking will this make a game unplayable, this can represent a problem.  GURPS presents to player both options, with in our experience easy transition from one style of play into the other, in case the group wants to change the way they play the current game.  Low action economy in both the mechanics heavy and light version allows for a fast-paced game, where there is low waiting time between player turns. 
            </p>
           <p>
            Finally, play the game that you want! With this system the game can be focused on the combat heavy game, as well as a skill-based game that may not have any combat at all but instead focuses on investigation, exploration, intrigue and/or player focused world building.
