The forum contains sections related to various topics such as multiple settings, ideas for next campaigns, custom-made creatures and characters, etc. This forum is the best resource to improve your game or find tools that the community has worked on to a specific style of gameplay you want to implement in your play.

        <h2>Virtual tabletop</h2>
        <p>
            Virtual tabletops (VTT) or tabletop simulators are video game programs designed to allow users to recreate existing games or create their own games to play with others online. The game typically provided a game engine with numerous pre-made tabletop game assets like dice, tokens, and cards and allows players to create or import their own. <!-- text source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_tabletop_game -->  
        </p>
        <div class="section-images">
            <img src="../assets/images/maidens_garden.jpg" alt="maidens_garden">  <!-- image created in Campaign Cartographer 3 by author of this site -->
        </div>
        <p>
            The game may have limited scripting ability so that some of the tabletop game's functions can be automated, but otherwise, players are expected to know the rules and play them out as given, simply using the virtual tabletop as a game board. This can create copyright concerns since art assets from the published game get distributed freely through user mods. Some tabletop game developers have embraced these programs by offering their games as official downloadable content for the simulator program. <!-- text source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_tabletop_game -->

            <h3>Roll20</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://roll20.net/" target="_blank" rel="external_link" class="external_link">Roll20</a> is a website consisting of a set of tools for playing tabletop role-playing games, also referred to as a virtual tabletop, which can be used as an aid to playing in person or remotely online. Roll20 is a browser-based suite of tools that allows users to create and play tabletop role playing games. It is organized into individual game sessions, which users can create or join.
            </p>
            <p>
                These game sessions include various features of typical tabletop RPGs, including dynamic character sheets, automated dice rolling, shared maps with basic character and enemy tokens, and triggered sound effects, as well as a character creation tool for certain licensed game systems. The interface also includes integrated text chat, voice chat, and video chat, as well as Google Hangouts integration. <!-- text source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll20 -->

            </div>
            <p>
                We recommend using Roll20 for first-time users of VTTs. It is free, and  in our experience, the easiest to use of currently available free VTTs with integrated features from third-party developers like <a href=https://tabletopaudio.com/ target="_blank" rel="external_link" class="external_link">Tabletop audio</a>. Roll20 also has a subscription option that adds additional features to improve the game experience, but it is not required for the majority of games.

            <h3>Additional VTTs</h3>
            <p>
                While Roll20 is one of the most popular VTTs, there are other options. Each VTT has its pros and cons. Some are easier to get into, while others have more features and dedicated communities working on add-ons to enhance the game experience. Below is the list of VTTs that we use:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-points"> 
                <li><a href="https://foundryvtt.com/" target="_blank" rel="external_link" class="external_link">Foundrt VTT</a> - one time purchase software with a dedicated community that works hard on add-ons to improve the game experience. The downside of this VTT is that hosting a game requires either renting of cloud server or <a href=https://foundryvtt.com/ target="_blank" rel="external_link" class="external_link"></a>port forwarding</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.astraltabletop.com/" target="_blank" rel="external_link" class="external_link">Astral Tabletop</a> - free to use VTT that has features similar to roll 20, elements like dynamic lighting are free and easy to use. The downside of this VTT is that it can be buggy for players sometimes. </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/home.php" target="_blank" rel="external_link" class="external_link">Fantasy Grounds</a> - is a paid software that contains various build-in features for an enhanced game experience. We recommend this software to people that already have experience with VTTs, and know what they experience they want for their gaming group. The downside of this software is that you have to purchase an additional add-on for every game system and module.</li>

    <h2>Maps</h2>
    <p>
        Whether you are playing theater of the mind or a more tactical grid-based game, you will need a map for some of your games. A map can be hand-drawn or made in various software.
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet-points"> 
        <li>Tactical map – is usually used in combat to give players visual information where objects, enemies, obstacles, and allies are at any point in time. These maps typically cover a couple of rooms, a building, or a dungeon.</li>
        <li>Town map – gives a visual layout of a base location that could be any type of settlement (city, village, space station, bunker, ship) with markers of key locations that players will visit during the game.</li>
        <li>Regional map – sometimes also called world maps gives an overview to players where the game takes place. This type of map is used to give players an overview of key locations in the game, the feeling of distance and travel, and landmarks that give substance to the game world.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Maps can contain as many or little details that are needed. Tactical maps are best to have enough details to give players the feeling of where the most important objects are on the map. For a city map, it is enough to have simple city blocks and pointers to key locations. As a general rule, it is best to build the regional map from the inside out starting from the base location. This gives GMs an easier way to plan the next adventure, and players have an experience of exploration that provides that the world is big, mysterious and there are places to be charted.

        <h3>Random map generators</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes you have a creative block or busy weeks that prevent you from creating maps to fit into your game. Sometimes you do not know what you want, and a random map can help you give ideas for your next adventure. Random generators are great tools to help you improve your game. The following free random map generators are the ones that we recommend for new as well as experienced GMs:
