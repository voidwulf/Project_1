            Basics
            <h2>Basics</h2>
            <p>
                GURPS is a point buying system where you spend character point to purchase mechanical elements to build a character that you want to play. Think about these elements as different kind of Lego bricks as you build your character.  These elements are recorded on the character sheet after purchase. 
            </p>
            <h3>Stats</h3>
            <p>
                These character elements are building blocks of your character that can be divided into three major broad categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attributes – These elements are your primary and secondary attributes such as Strength (ST), Dexterity (DX), hit points (HP) etc.</li>
                <li>Advantages and disadvantages - These elements are your physical, social, mental, and supernatural traits that define your character and give them certain advantages or hinderances during the course of game.</li>
                <li>Skills – these elements represent your characters training, knowledge, and expertise in specific field that you can apply to solve a challenge during your adventures.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There are additional statistics that are calculated and filled out based on the above statistics. These can be found on the character sheet with appropriate calculations for these statistics.
            </p>
            <h3>Equipment</h3>
            <p>
                Equipment is gear that your characters use during their adventures. Gear can be divided into three broad categories: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Weapons – equipment used to attack and deal damages</li>
                <li>Armor – equipment used for reducing incoming damages and harms from attack and environment</li>
                <li>MISC – gear not related to combat, and it can be fall in any other category. This type of equipment can be different tools to do a specialized task like mechanics toolkit, or it can be something like a vehicle to bring you from point A to point B.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Action and dice rolling</h3>
            <p>Whether your characters are attacking in combat, disarming a bomb or charming the baron’s kitchen worker to get the entrance trough the kitchen into the manor, all these actions require a roll. These rolls can be divided into two categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Static roll - where you roll 3 six-sided die against your skill or attribute, with added modifier. The goal is to roll the value to your skill and lower in order to pass. If you subtract your dice from the target value, the difference shows what is the margin of success. </li>
                <li>Competing roll - when two characters are competing against each other, be it in combat, debate, race or any other dramatic moment, both characters roll against respective skill or attribute. The winner is the one with the higher margin of success. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What you need to start?</h2>
            <p>
                It is quite simple. All you need to start and keep your games going for years is three or more six-sided dice, two core rule books and some friends to play with.
            </p>
            <p>
                For new players we recommend trying the GURPS lite version first that can be found on the Steve Jackson Games web site. It is free 34 pages rule book that is comprehensible light rule guide that offers the most common games elements used during a typical game. It is perfect to new players to GURPS and table tope RPG games in general, and helps you decide is GURPS a game for you before you invest your fully commit to the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, what you need is some pen and paper, or any other tool that will help you record statistic of your characters, keep notes on adventure and help game master to prepare for the sessions to present to players.

            <h2>Settings</h2>
            <p>
                To play a game and incorporate player’s characters into the story, you will need a place with its own flavour, inhabitants, and conflicts. This is called a setting. A setting can be anything from a world, continent, kingdom, town or even just a neighbourhood block where your game will take place in.  Think about it like a stage with supporting actors where the players are the main stars and GM is the director that is responsible for the scenery and directing the supporting actors, as well as bringing flavour of that setting to the audience that are your players. Below are three suggestions of settings suited for beginners.   
            </p>
            <h3>Classic fantasy dungeon crawl</h3>
            <p>
                This type of setting is usually set in a medieval Europe inspired world with magic and mystical creatures. In this setting there are usually additional sentient races inspired by Tolkien’s work like dwarfs, elves, halflings etc. Players are playing adventurers who are exploring the dungeon.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this setting all you need to start is three major locations: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Base location: usually a town safe place where players come for rest, restock on supplies, obtain quests, buy gear, and sell loot</li>
                <li>Dungeon:  this can be an underground dungeon, a cavern system, or an old labyrinth in the forest where players explore </li>
                <li>Quest location: A specific part of the dungeon that player visit to fulfil the quest</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In classic fantasy crawl your major focus is the exploration of the dungeon. Typical elements of an adventure are:   
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exploration of dungeon location</li>
                <li>Hidden traps and treasures </li>
                <li>Evil creature that needs to be eliminated</li>
                <li>Rescue a character from a dungeon</li>
                <li>Retrieving a powerful relic</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Apocalypse survival </h3>
            <p>
                Apocalypse survival settings can be set in any kind of world and era, but the most classic one is modern era set up in our world. Players play survivors in a world that has been devastated by an event that destroyed the society and/or world that we know it. There are two important things to think about an apocalypse setting: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What caused the apocalypse?</li>
                <li>What is the end goal of the survivor group?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                What is the end goal of the survivor group?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Zombie outbreak: the society has collapsed, the waling dead swarm in city areas, where remnants of living are grouped into enclaves competing for limited resources </li>
                <li>Rise of the machine: rogue AI has taken over; humans are targeted for extermination. Players are survivors are either resistance fighting off the machine or in hiding trying to survive as long as they can. </li>
                <li>Nuclear apocalypse: for some reason or the other nuclear bombs went off and turned the world into eh nuclear wasteland. The players are survivors traversing the wasteland, fighting off marauders and mutated monsters, and salvaging resources to survive.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Here are couple of goals of survivor group that could be played through a session or multiple session:  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reach location: the goal is to reach a specific location, this location can be a safe bunker shelter, promised land or a pickup location where the rescue team is located.</li>
                <li>Survive: it is simple, players need to survive whatever the environment is throwing at you.</li>
                <li>Find answers: find clues and find the answer to what or who caused the apocalypse.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cyberpunk noir</h3>
            <p>
                Cyberpunk settings are usually dystopian setting of a near or far future, where world is ruled by mega corporations, cybernetic implants are everywhere, and people life is less valued than the technology they are using. Majority population is living bellow the poverty line, and players are either specialist working shady jobs, detectives investigating grotesque murder crimes or corporate suits covering for their company unless they risk being fired and end on the street.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are couple of adventure ideas for cyber punk setting:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conspiracy: players are doing their job to get that next pay check, just to discovered that they are entangled in some larger government/corporation conspiracy</li>
                <li>Dead man switch: one of player’s acquaintances died, and the dead man switch has activated informing you to find a stolen tech that will help you get out of slums</li>
                <li>Crime investigation: players are part of police force, investigating trafficking of illegally acquired cybertech. They must choose to either be overt to provoke the local crime boss or covert to get to the potential informants.</li>
            </ul>
