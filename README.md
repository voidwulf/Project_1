## Features

This informational site has the following features developed to achive the goal of informing the user about a tabletop game while making it easy and comftable to read:

* Hero Image and cover text 
* Header
* Footer
* Informative text and content and comfortable background
* Images that communicate the idea visually
* Links that point to resources and topic of interest

Features are explained in more detail below, as well as future features that are planed to be implemented for this site.


### Hearo Image and cover text

The hero image on this site consists of three six-sided dice representing the signature mechanic of the GURPS system, with an eye-pleasing colored background that feels welcoming. A simple representation of dice is intended to communicate to an aspiring player that this is still a game. Dice being the most commonly used six-sided design would suggest that the content is intended to be light and enjoyable.

Cover text on the hero image with a transparent background is one of the first things visitors will see. This is the pitch to newcomers. A very short and inspiring speech that tells the user what this site is about in the first 5 seconds. Text and background color scheme for this cover text was selected to be eye-appealing and complimentary with header and hearo image.

### Header

The header contains the site's logo and a nave bar. Header background color (#1b1b1b) has been chosen to compliment the background color of the site. The color scheme of logo and nav bar menu was chosen to be clear and visible on the header background, making it obvious to the user.

Underline nav bar lists items indicates to users what is the current page that they are reading. The hovering feature helps users tell the page they will click on by displaying an underlined text while hovering with the mouse pointer. 


### Footer

The footer contains four icons to point the user to the social media. Icons have been imported from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). The color scheme for icon styling has been selected to compliment the page background and header. The icon size has been styled to be obvious and nicely laid out for all devices.

The following four social media platform have been chosen, as they represent the best option for gaming community support:
* Facebook - a Facebook group is the most common way to get in touch with the audience, build a community where experiences and ideas are exchanged
* YouTube - a most common platform to communicate information via audio and video. This platform will serve to easily provide examples implemented in a real game as well as a video tutorial. YouTube is also a good platform to host "Ask me anything" videos where the visitors' questions can be answered.
* Pinterest - a simple platform that is used to present the exciting things that we work on our games and share with the rest of the community. 
* Discord - the most common tool used in the gaming community. It is a simple to use platform where the site owner will create a server. Servers is branched in various text and voice channels. Ideal tool for holding a forum-based discussion. These channels can be used as having breakout rooms where the community can discuss specific topic or play a game. This tool will be used to help grow the community, help users of the site answer their questions, and help them get started with a possible online play. 

### Text content and backgroung

Text content has been based on the site author's experience with the GURPS game system. The information has been broken down into small, easy-to-understand sections with the intent to spark curiosity for readers. Text font and color have been choosing to be easy to read. The maximal paragraph width has been selected based on mentor constructive feedback and internet research. The result of the research was a text that easy comfortable to read with a rewarding feeling of progression as the user progresses through the page. 

<img src="assets/images/Feature_4.JPG" alt="text-and-bacground">

Background color scheme was created to compliment the text and headers using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/). The color has been optimized to calm the eyes and retain some color resemblance to the [GURPS community forum](https://forums.sjgames.com/forumdisplay.php?f=13). During development, the selected color scheme showed to be more comfortable to look at during long screen time, and the decision was made to keep the current color scheme. 

### Images

Most images were taken from Pixabay (please see credits), while the rest were taken as screenshots from personal campaign material and photos of the books I owned.  
Due to the GURPS flexibility and the message of that flexibility aimed to be communicated, it was hard to find images with a consistent style. Images are carefuly chosen and placed with a systematic intent. 

The first image of a knight on the index page is of a drawing that communicates to the visitor simple visual information on how the system is flexible, who told any additional details on the image that may indicate the game's complexity.  

<img src="assets/images/Feature_5.JPG" alt="site-images">

On the basic information page, the first two images contain an art style that appeals more to the audience born during 80's and early 90's, while the last three images appeal more to the audience that prefers the modern art style. The text content between tyle serves as a separation to avoid inconsistency in art while appeasing both user populations. Image of the GURPS books found in the content between these two art styles serves as a natural visual adaptation as the user reads throw the content.

Images on an additional information page were selected to show the user what else is out there and an inspiration to get them to kick off their creative journey. 

### Links

Links on this site can be devided in two broad groups:
* Footer icons - clicable links that point the user to the social media platform
* Text links - links in the text that point the user to the resources

<img src="assets/images/Feature_6.JPG" alt="site links">

Text links are bolded with a color scheme that makes them stand out from the rest of the text. Colors have been chosen to be obvious and comfortable to read. Text links also have a hovering effect that changes the text's color and shows it in a black box to indicate to the user that they are hovering over the link. All links open a new tab when clicked to keep the user on the current page. 

### Features to implement

Folloging features are planed to be implemented in the future development of this site:
* A dedicated page that will provide more ideas for game settings
* Interactive workbench feature that will help users better understand character creation 
* A mini game tool that will help user learn the basics by tring an easy scenario

## Testing

Testing has been performed before and after site deployment. 

* CSS code has been validated using Jigsaw W3C. Errors encountered were during this validation were blank spaces in font naming. An error has been fixed, and validation has passed.  Additional validation has been performed after deployment as the code was debugged and additional lines added of code added to support smaller screen size.

<img src="assets/images/CSS-validation.JPG" alt="site links">

* HTML code for all three pages has been validated using W3C validator – additional code changes have been made to the code to pass the validation. An additional element has been added to hero image section to pass validation and serve as an inspirational text. 

<img src="assets/images/HTML-validation.JPG" alt="site links">

* Unicorn revealer add-on was used to inspect the web page overflow – This tool proved useful during the pre-deployment phase. The majority of the overflow issues during deployment have been encountered around the header and first section area with tablet size screen. The second issue was encountered during the addition of the cover message addition to the hero image.

<img src="assets/images/overflow.JPG" alt="site links">

* Google dev tools have been used for debugging issues during the deployment phase. The majority of issues have been related to the image path that was not visible in the pre-deployment phase. Dev tools have also been used to fix the overflow errors before editing the code in the editor.

<img src="assets/images/debugigng-1.JPG" alt="site links">

* Lighthouse has been used to assess the usability and performance of the site. For all three pages, one of the issues was the size of the images. Decompression has been performed.

Additional information page

Additional issues need to be fixed to improve usability ( edit ccs code), which is left to resolve later due to time limitations. Other areas of improvement are related to reducing the overflow of elements.
